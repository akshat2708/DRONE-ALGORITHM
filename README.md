IMPLEMENTATION:-

To design an algorithm for guiding multiple drones in a 2-D space, we can follow these steps:

Define the problem: The problem is to guide multiple drones to their respective destinations in a 2-D space without causing any collisions or conflicts. The input to the algorithm includes the number of drones, their starting positions, end positions, and start time.

Create a 2-D grid: Create a 2-D grid of size M x N, where each cell in the grid represents a point in space. This grid will be used to represent the space in which the drones will fly.

Initialize the drones: Initialize the drones with their starting positions, end positions, and start times. Assign a unique identifier to each drone.

Determine the path for each drone: For each drone, use an algorithm such as A* or Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the optimal path from its starting position to its end position. This path should be collision-free and should avoid any obstacles or other drones in the space.

Assign time slots to each drone: Once the path for each drone is determined, assign a time slot to each drone to start flying. The time slot should be such that no two drones collide with each other or conflict with each other in any way.

Guide the drones: At the assigned time slots, guide each drone to follow its respective path. Monitor the drones' positions and ensure that they do not collide with each other or any other obstacles.

Update the positions of the drones: As the drones fly, update their positions in the grid. This will ensure that collisions are detected and avoided.

Terminate the algorithm: Terminate the algorithm once all drones reach their respective destinations.

Overall, the algorithm should be able to guide multiple drones to their destinations in a 2-D space without causing any collisions or conflicts. It should be scalable to handle a large number of drones and should be able to handle unexpected changes in the environment or drone behavior.
